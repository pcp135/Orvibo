Orvibo S20 smart socket PHP API
=============

This code base started from [my project](https://github.com/pcp135/HomeAutomation) to control some [LimitlessLED Smart-Lights](http://limitlessled.com) bulbs through a web interface hosted on a Raspberrypi.  

Over time my project expanded to include also some [Orvibo S20](http://www.orvibo.com/en_products_view.asp?mid=15&pid=4&id=234) smart sockets for which I couldn't find any existing PHP API so wrote this one using the reverse engineered data available from various sources, particularly the [Ninja Blocks Java API](https://github.com/Grayda/ninja-allone).

Please feel free to include this code in your own projects and further develop and expand to support more of the features of the Orvibo smart sockets if you like.
